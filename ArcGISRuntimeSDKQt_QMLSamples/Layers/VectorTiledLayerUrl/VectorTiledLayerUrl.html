<p>This sample uses Vector Tiled Layer basemap from an ArcGIS Online service URL. It shows how to creates an ArcGISVectorTiledLayer from an ArcGIS Online service URL and bind that to a Basemap. When a new item is selected from the combo box, a JavaScript function that determines the currently selected basemap is executed. The map's basemap is replaced by simply calling the writable basemap property, passing in the desired basemap.</p>
