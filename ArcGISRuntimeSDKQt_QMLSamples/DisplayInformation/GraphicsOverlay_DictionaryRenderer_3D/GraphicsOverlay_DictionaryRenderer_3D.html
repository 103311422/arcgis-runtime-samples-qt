<p>This sample demonstrates applying a dictionary renderer to graphics, in order to display military symbology without the need for a feature layer. The sample loads a number of point, line, and polygon military elements from an XML file and adds them as graphics to a GraphicsOverlay. A DictionaryRenderer is applied to the GraphicsOverlay in order to display the graphics with MIL-STD-2525D military symbology. When all graphics are created, the 3D scene's viewpoint is set to zoom to the full extent of all graphics.</p>
