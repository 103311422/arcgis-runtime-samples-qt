<p>This sample shows how to open an existing map with the Runtime SDK for Qt. In this case, the existing maps are web maps stored in ArcGIS Online as portal items. The portal items are presented in a list view with the portal item's thumbnail and title. When a portal item is selected from the view, a new map is constructed with that portal item, and the map view is assigned the new map.</p>
