<p>This is one of the most basic samples for the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt. It shows how to create a map view, and add in a map that contains the imagery with labels basemap. An initial viewpoint is set on the map so that when the map loads, it will automatically be centered and scaled appropriately. By default, this map supports basic zooming and panning operations.</p>
