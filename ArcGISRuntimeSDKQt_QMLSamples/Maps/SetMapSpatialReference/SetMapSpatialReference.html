<p>This sample demonstrates how you can set the spatial reference on a Map and all the operational layers would project accordingly. The map is initialized with esriSRProjCS_World_Bonne (WKID: 54024) spatial reference. Hence the map image layer that is added, with default spatial reference as GCS_WGS_1984 (WKID: 4326), gets re-projected to map's spatial reference.</p>
