This sample demonstrates how to open and display a map from a Mobile Map Package.

##How it works

This sample takes a Mobile Map Package that was created in ArcGIS Pro, and displays a `Map` from within the package in a `MapView`. This is accomplished by calling `load` on the `MobileMapPackage`, and waiting for its load status to be Completed. Once the package is loaded, you can access its maps, and assign one of the maps to be viewed in the `MapView`.
