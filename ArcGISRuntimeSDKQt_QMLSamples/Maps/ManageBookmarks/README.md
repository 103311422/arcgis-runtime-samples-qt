##How it works

The map in the sample comes pre-populated with a set of bookmarks. You can tap on the bookmarks combo box to view the list. Then select a bookmark to update the map's viewpoint. To create a new bookmark, pan and/or zoom to a new location and tap on the + button. You will be prompted to provide a name for the new bookmark. When you tap Done the new bookmark should also show up in the list.
