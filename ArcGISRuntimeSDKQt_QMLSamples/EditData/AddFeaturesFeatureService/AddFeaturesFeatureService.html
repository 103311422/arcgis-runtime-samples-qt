<p>This sample demonstrates how to add features to a feature service. Tap on a location in the map view to add a feature at that location. This workflow is accomplished through obtaining the map point from the mouse event on the map view. Once the map point is obtained, attributes must be created. This is done by creating a JSON of key/value pairs for the field name and field value. Once the geometry and attributes are ready, the feature can be created through the createFeatureWithAttributes method. To add the feature to the feature table, call addFeature, and pass in the new feature. Finally, to update the service, call the applyEdits method, and this will apply the feature edits to the service.</p>
