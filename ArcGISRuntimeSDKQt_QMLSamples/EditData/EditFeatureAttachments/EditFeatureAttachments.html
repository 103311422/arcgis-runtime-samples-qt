<p>The sample demonstrates how to add, delete, and fetch attachments for a specific feature in a feature service.

Tapping on a feature, shows a callout. The callout specifies the number of attachments for that particular feature. Tapping on the info button inside the callout shows the list of those attachments. In the list you can add a new attachment by tapping on the + button. You can delete an attachment by selecting an attachment and tapping on the - button. This is all controlled through the attachment list model, which is obtained through the feature. The attachment list model works similar to other QML models, and can be directly fed into a list view for easy display and user interaction. In order to use the model in a view, you must first call fetchAttachmentInfos, which will request the attachment info JSON from the service. This JSON contains information such as name (the file name) and attachmentUrl (the URL to the file data), among other things. Calling addAttachment and then applyEdits will add an attachment to a feature in a feature service, while deleteAttachment followed by applyEdits will delete an attachment from a feature in a feature service.</p>
