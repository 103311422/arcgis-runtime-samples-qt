<p>This sample demonstrates how to delete a feature from a feature service.

Tapping on a feature displays a callout. To delete the feature from the feature service, tap the delete button in the callout. This button will invoke the deleteFeature method from the feature table, at which point the feature will be deleted from the table. To update the service, call the applyEdits method, and this will apply the edits to the service, and the feature will be deleted from the service.</p>
