<p>The sample demonstrates how to update geometry of a feature in a feature service.

Tapping on a feature on the map selects and highlights the feature. Clicking on another location on the map moves the feature to the new location. This is done by first obtaining the feature after it is selected. Once the feature is obtained, the feature's geometry is updated by setting the geometry property to the new map point. To update the feature in the feature table, call updateFeature, and pass in the edited feature. Finally, to update the service, call the applyEdits method, and this will apply the geometry edits to the service.</p>
