<p>This sample loads a number of point, line, and polygon military elements from an XML file and adds them as graphics to a `GraphicsOverlay`. A `DictionaryRenderer` is applied to the `GraphicsOverlay` in order to display the graphics with MIL-STD-2525D military symbology. When all graphics are created, the map's viewpoint is set to zoom to the full extent of all graphics.</p>
