<p>The sample loads a number of point military elements from an XML file and adds them as graphics to a GraphicsOverlay. A DictionaryRenderer is applied to the GraphicsOverlay in order to display the graphics with MIL-STD-2525D military symbology. The GraphicsOverlay's renderingMode parameter is set to GraphicsRenderingMode::Dynamic, so that point features are displayed with billboarded symbols facing the user (a developer can set renderingMode to GraphicsRenderingMode::Static if desired to instead drape the symbols on the surface). When all graphics are created, the 3D scene's viewpoint is set to zoom to the full extent of all graphics.</p>
