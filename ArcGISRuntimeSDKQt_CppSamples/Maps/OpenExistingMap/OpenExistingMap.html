<p>This sample demonstrates how to open an existing map.
</p>
<p>The existing maps are web maps stored in ArcGIS Online as portal items. The web maps are presented in a list view with the thumbnail and title. When a web map is selected, a new map object is created from the URL, and the new map object is assigned the map view.
